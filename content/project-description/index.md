  Personicle is a personal chronicle of ones lifestyle, health, social,
  environmental, and other events alongside all associated information and data
  for a person. Personicle is a time-indexed database of events and their
  attributes for a person. Earlier versions of such systems with limited
  applications and scopes have been called lifelog and digital twins.

  A Personicle System (referred to as PS), however, is a collection of
  Personicles available for the benefit of a population or society. Better
  disease models could be built for sub-populations by aggregating individuals
  in a population that share certain individual attributes (for e.g., all people
  of Indian origin in their sixties, living in southern California, working in
  academic fields). Thus, many different population groups may be studied based
  on appropriate collection of individuals. This has become especially important
  given the power of technology allowing for the personalization of medical
  interventions and mnanagement. Increasing emphasis in health-related
  disciplines is on developing personalized, predictive, precise, and
  participatory approaches to guide people to manage their future in most
  desirable way to maximize quality of health leading naturally to better
  quality of life. In health, Personalized, Predictive, Preventive, and Precise
  approaches to managing health are rapidly gaining popularity. These
  approaches, commonly called P4, or Px, in healthcare, primarily depend on
  building a person’s model and using it to predict potential health issues in
  future to prevent them using precise guidance specifically customized for the
  person.


  P4 approaches depends on the developement of a personal model for every
  individual. Every guidance or recommendation system uses current state and
  personal models. Personal models have been and are being used extensively in
  most the popular consumer applications in this century. All search engines,
  shopping sites, and social networks build personal profiles based on
  interactions that a person has on their site. They collect logs of relevant
  data from interactions with every user on their site and from any other
  relevant information sources for their application. These logs are then used
  to build personal profiles or personal models for their use. Once built, this
  profile is used to help in search or recommendation as well as targeting
  advertisements for company’s monetization. While personal models have been
  used for the economic benefit of companies, their principle structure for
  predictability is extremely powerful as a tool for anticipating health
  concerns. For healthcare applications, the personal model must be derived
  using an objective log of a person’s genome, lifestyle activities,
  environmental exposures (called exposomes), and accurate biological
  measurements. Each person’s body reacts differently to the same lifestyle
  actions, exposome(s), and social inputs. A personal model captures effects of
  all these factors on the individual’s health by relating health related
  biomarkers and inputs from the person to all events surrounding the person.
  This personal model is essential in predicting and guiding the person based on
  their current health state and context. These factors are what are combined
  together to develop a Personicle. While personal models are ubiquitous,
  Personicles are distinguished by their ability to comprehensively predict
  health outcomes without generalizing individuals into certain patterns to make
  predictions. Therefore the core advantage of Personicles are the individuality
  in predictions that they can make for peoples health - a complexity in
  predictability within healthcare that is not currently being done.The most
  challenging component in this is building a good quality Personicle of the
  person and then building the personal model using event mining or other
  related AI tools which are then combined with recognizing and collating
  relevant medical/biological knowledge into these relationships. Good models
  require good quality and detailed logs of data that could be analyzed to build
  high quality models. Paraphrasing a popular saying of computer science: poor
  logs (garbage in); poor models (garbage out).


  Personicle makes this process of collecting logs of all relevant data streams
  for understanding and building personal model or personal profile explicit and
  could be designed for specific health and other applications. Most data
  streams must be converted to semantic events in them. The events may be of
  different types, such as events in a data stream, or events in life derived
  from multiple data streams or supplied by an individual source. All these
  events may be explicitly represented in Personicle using an event model that
  provides more information about an event.


  Personal models must have two very important attributes:
  human-understandability, and predictive power. Predictive power is essential
  to understand future implications of the current states (contexts) for the
  individual and human understandability requires representing causality that
  people can understand and use. People understand life events and features of
  these events and can relate to those. For human-understandability, it is
  essential to convert all logged data to common life-events and their features
  and use event mining techniques to build personal models.


  A Personicle may be created either for a specific application over a limited
  period, or it may be an exhaustive chronicle of all events from pre-natal to
  the passing of the person. Essentially a Personicle is a person centered,
  event indexed, chronicle containing all relevant data about a person over a
  certain time-period and for specific applications. A Personicle for health
  applications is created to keep a record of all data streams related to a
  person and life events derived from this data to apply appropriate machine
  learning, AI, and other analytical approaches to create a model of a person
  that could be used for monitoring health, for providing information to
  healthcare providers about the health of the person, and for creating a model
  of the person for applying predictive, preventive, precise, and personalized
  approaches. Currently, all these tasks are performed using shallow episodic
  data, resulting in misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. This often leads
  to mistrust in the technology and therefore regression into traditional
  methods for localization and management of health concerns while the focus on
  prevention being placed on the backburner in favor of managing the presenting
  concerns. A Personicle brings the power of sensors and data-driven approaches
  to provide right and precise information to the right stakeholders in the
  right context; thereby allowing for an effective intervention if needed but
  furthur stretching to predicting possible concerns before they can happen -
  allowing for an effective automation of prevention. An important objective of
  Personicle is to provide an environment to collect data from diverse data
  streams and other data sources centered on and about a person. All data about
  the person is synchronized and stored in a specific form factor for different
  applications to use as needed by them after being permitted by the user. This
  way, the primary owner of the data is still the person who will transparently
  know who is using and how their using their health data to make these
  predictions. The person decides what data should be collected, what kind of
  processing may be permitted using this data, and who may have access to
  different data items during different periods - all done through a platform
  that will transparently showcase this. A personicle is a log of all relevant
  data for a person indexed using semantic events. This allows for modeling a
  person in the context of managing specific aspect of her life using predictive
  approaches to provide recommendations to maximize quality of experiences.
  Indexing using human understandable semantic events is important for human
  interaction and allows us to use events as a bundle of all information and
  data. These events should be automatically detected so that minimal
  interaction is required on the part of a user.
