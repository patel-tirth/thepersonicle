					<h5>Personicle is a personal chronicle of ones lifestyle, health, social, environmental, and other events alongside all associated information and data for a person. Personicle is a time-indexed database of events and their attributes for a person. Earlier versions of such systems with limited applications and scopes have been called lifelog and digital twins. A Personicle System (referred to as PS), however, is a collection of Personicles available for the benefit of a population or society. Better disease models could be built for sub-populations by aggregating individuals in a population that share certain individual attributes (for e.g., all people of Indian origin in their sixties, living in southern California, working in academic fields). Thus, many different population groups may be studied based on appropriate collection of individuals. This has become especially important given the power of technology allowing for the personalization of medical interventions and management. Increasing emphasis in health-related disciplines is on developing personalized, predictive, precise, and participatory approaches to guide people to manage their future in most desirable way to maximize quality of health leading naturally to better quality of life. In health, Personalized, Predictive, Preventive, and Precise approaches to managing health are rapidly gaining popularity. These approaches, commonly called P4, or Px, in healthcare, primarily depend on building a person&rsquo;s model and using it to predict potential health issues in future to prevent them using precise guidance specifically customized for the person.</h5>

					<h5>A Personicle is a chronicle of all events for the person. These events will be used to build their &lsquo;model&rsquo; for understanding the underlying causes for various health outcomes: such as what caused the food allergy, or what resulted in major emotional upset. Such a model combined with their current situation(s), may help in the prediction of future situations as well as ways to prevent those situations. For each person, there will be a core Personicle that is developed through data being inputted from various application. Different applications may add a greater variety of data sources, events, and algorithms to extract more relevant information that will then be added to their core Personicle allowing for a transparent automation of inputs.</h5>
