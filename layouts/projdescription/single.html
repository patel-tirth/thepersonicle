					<h5>We need to leverage a variety of data sources for creating a holistic personicle. These include (but are not limited to) smart phone, smart watches (on-device sensors), medical devices, research-grade sensors, smart phone applications and GPS systems. The personal data can be further enriched using freely available public information such as weather and pollution data. Data generated by the individuals can be categorized along different dimensions. We primarily categorize different types of data based on their generation mechanism. The data generation frequency determines whether a particular data stream is continuous, periodic, or episodic. Additionally, the data generating source determines whether the data are objective, subjective, or derived from another objective or subjective data. Continuous data represents data streams that are continuously being generated by a device irrespective of the user activity. These include data collected from the sensors and devices such as accelerometer, temperature, heart rate etc.</h5>

					<h2>Goal</h2>
					<h5>A Personicle is a chronicle of all events for the person. These events will be used to build their &lsquo;model&rsquo; for understanding the underlying causes for various health outcomes: such as what caused the food allergy, or what resulted in major emotional upset.Such a model combined with their current situation(s), may help in the prediction of future situations as well as ways to prevent those situations.For each person, there will be a core Personicle that is developed through data being inputted from various application. Different applications may add a greater variety of data sources, events, and algorithms to extract more relevant information that will then be added to their core Personicle allowing for a transparent automation of inputs.</h5>
