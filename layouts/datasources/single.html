					<h5>Data is essential for deriving information and knowledge for human life and society. Public health departments in the United Staes have always continously collected a variety of data paradigmns to be able to describe an accurate description of their populations health, and at times of necessary intervention, use it to plan dissemination of it. A Personicle is designed to do just this but at a personal level. The advantage of this is that public health interventions will have to provide the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people - which will often lead non-tailored solutions that will only solve the problem for each individual to various degrees. Thus sacrificing full efficacy for greatest dissemination. Essentially a population based solution will be efficacious to only a certain degree for each person within that population. There maybe individuals who may experience the full benefit, but that is generally only a marginal proportion compared to the rest of people who may never have a full solution due to their subjective variables. To then be able to develop the best intervention for a population means to tailor the solution to each specific person, drastically increasing the chance that the solution will be effective. This requires an individualized model which has been difficult due to lack of methods to coallate these points. But the advantage of this model will be that the need for solutions will be identified while a simultensouly individualized solution can be developed that is underlying an overall theme of intervention. This will bypass the limitations that current methods of population based interventions possess such as those done by public health institutions. The data points that are collected by these public health systems can equally be used to predict individual outcomes just as they do population ones. Given the diversity and specificity in health outcomes based on a variety of variables, such as how life expectancy can vary based on zipcodes even if they are within the same county, an individualized platform will become the most efficacious. Therefore data from multimodal diverse sources must be collected and perpetually analyzed to build the model of the person and understand the health state of a person as well as society.&nbsp;</h5>

					<h5>Genomic information about the users can provide valuable insights into their health behavior and outcomes. DNA testing and genetic sequencing have gained popularity in the last few years due to readily available consumer grade sequencing (e.g., 23andme). These applications provide a shallow insight into user health and behavior using known genetic markers (from biomedical literature) for health and behavioral outcomes. The Personicle should leverage this information to provide a deeper and more accurate view of individual health and behavioral outcomes. However, due to the differences in scale, structure, and utility of the genomic data, we need to process and store it separately from the other demographic and individual level features.</h5>

					<h5>Situations in a personal context are a specific combination of events and states that hold special significance in the application domain. Typically, the situations last over significantly longer durations than events and impact the events that occur during the situation. For example, &ldquo;SAT preparation&rdquo; is one possible situation for a high school student and is likely to lead to a change in observed distribution of life events. In many health cases, situations may refer to diseases that need attention and determine the relative importance of different events and data streams. A situation may need following information:</h5>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h5>Name of situation</h5>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Intensity of situation</h5>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>Any actions required</h5>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h5>People to be informed</h5>
						</li>

					<h5>Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) have been defined as the &ldquo;conditions in which the individuals live, learn, work and play&rdquo;. These conditions have a great impact on health and quality of life risks and outcomes and contribute to various chronic disease risk factors such as stress, access to clean water and electricity, access to healthcare etc. Imbalances in any of these factors creates a compounding effect that can precipitate a myriad of health conditions. Each of the factors are interdepednet upon each other and contribute to an overall picture of wellnes of an individual. This is beause the determinants not only take into account the factors that directly affect ones health, such as access to healthcare, others including education and neighborhood environments are recognized to illustrate the importance of a holistic picture of a persons life and how that will contribute to any possiblke pathology incidence. The social determinants of health are grouped into (a) Education Access and Quality, (b) Heath Care Access and Quality, (c) Economic Stability, (d) Social and Community Context, and (e) Neighborhood and Built Environment. Measures for each of these features can be readily accessed from servers and datasets maintained by government agencies (such as CDC) and matched with users&rsquo; home and work location to get a general gestalt of ones social determinants of health. Furthemore defintions for severity of experience for each of determinant in order to startify risk are readily available in the CDC's website as well. The application and use of these determinants to accurately assess ones deficiency in health management have been validated among numerous studies in the public health literature and therefore does represent a nuanced an accurate measurement of ones health situtation and furthurmore can also serve as a predictable model for future events.</h5>
